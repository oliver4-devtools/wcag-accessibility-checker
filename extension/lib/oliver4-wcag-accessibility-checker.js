    ['1.2.2','Captions (Prerecorded)','A','cond','Applies only if video with audio is embedded. Check captions exist and are accurate, not auto-generated.',10],

    ['1.2.4','Captions (Live)','AA','na','No live synchronised media in standard forms or views.',0],
    ['1.2.5','Audio Description (Prerecorded)','AA','cond','Applies only if video is embedded.',10],
    ['1.3.1','Info and Relationships','A','part','Automated checks cover labels, headings, tables and grouping. They cannot confirm that visual grouping matches structural grouping. Navigate with a screen reader to confirm.',20],
    ['1.3.2','Meaningful Sequence','A','part','The tool flags multi-column sections, where Unified Interface reads column by column rather than across rows. Read the form linearly with a screen reader to confirm meaning is preserved.',15],
    ['1.3.3','Sensory Characteristics','A','manual','Read every field description, notification and instruction. Fails if any says "click the red icon", "the field on the right" or similar.',10],
    ['1.3.4','Orientation','AA','cond','Applies to the Dynamics 365 mobile app and tablets only. Rotate the device and confirm the form remains operable.',10],
    ['1.3.5','Identify Input Purpose','AA','part','Applies only where the form collects the logged-in user’s own details. The tool reports whether autocomplete attributes are present. Decide applicability yourself.',10],
    ['1.4.1','Use of Colour','A','manual','Screenshot the form and view, convert to greyscale, and confirm no information is lost. Check status indicators, priority colouring and chart series.',10],
    ['1.4.2','Audio Control','A','na','No auto-playing audio in standard forms or views.',0],
    ['1.4.3','Contrast (Minimum)','AA','auto','Automated where the background resolves to a solid colour. Text over images, gradients and canvas-rendered charts must be checked manually.',10],
    ['1.4.4','Resize Text','AA','manual','Set browser zoom to 200% at 1280px width. Confirm nothing is clipped and all functions still work. JavaScript cannot set browser zoom.',10],

    ['1.4.10','Reflow','AA','part','The tool flags fixed-width elements. Confirm properly at 400% zoom or a 320px viewport. Data grids are exempt from the two-dimensional scrolling rule.',15],
    ['1.4.11','Non-text Contrast','AA','part','The tool samples control boundaries and fills, icon glyphs, and - in deep mode - focus indicators, against the surface behind them. Charts, images and anything drawn on a canvas still need sampling by hand.',20],
    ['1.4.12','Text Spacing','AA','auto','The tool applies the WCAG spacing overrides and measures for clipping. Re-check visually as well.',10],
    ['1.4.13','Content on Hover or Focus','AA','manual','Hover each tooltip trigger. Press Escape without moving the pointer (dismissible). Move onto the tooltip (hoverable). Confirm it does not auto-hide (persistent).',15],

    ['2.3.1','Three Flashes or Below Threshold','A','manual','Confirm nothing flashes more than three times per second. Low risk but must be evidenced as checked.',5],
    ['2.4.1','Bypass Blocks','A','part','The tool checks for landmarks and a skip link. Confirm you can actually reach the form content without tabbing the whole site map.',10],
    ['2.4.2','Page Titled','A','auto','The tool checks the document title exists and is not generic. Confirm it distinguishes this record from others.',5],
    ['2.4.3','Focus Order','A','part','The tool flags positive tabindex values and compares DOM order against declared form order. Tab through the form and confirm the order matches the data entry task.',20],
    ['2.4.4','Link Purpose (In Context)','A','part','The tool flags generic and raw-URL link text. Judge the rest against the column header context.',10],
    ['2.4.5','Multiple Ways','AA','manual','Assessed at app level. Confirm at least two routes exist to find a record: site map, search, recently viewed, dashboards.',10],
    ['2.4.6','Headings and Labels','AA','part','The tool flags default-looking, duplicate and over-long labels. Whether a label is genuinely descriptive is a human judgement.',15],
    ['2.4.7','Focus Visible','AA','part','Run in deep mode to focus each element and compare styles. Confirm visually, including in high contrast mode.',15],
    ['2.4.11','Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)','AA','manual','Tab down a long form and watch for fields scrolling behind the sticky header, command bar or notification bar. Repeat at 200% zoom.',15],
    ['2.5.1','Pointer Gestures','A','cond','Applies only where a path-based or multipoint gesture is required. Rare on desktop.',10],
    ['2.5.2','Pointer Cancellation','A','manual','Press the mouse down on each button, move away, then release. The action must not fire. Test destructive commands especially.',15],
    ['2.5.3','Label in Name','A','auto','The tool compares visible text against the computed accessible name. This is one of the most reliably automatable criteria.',10],
    ['2.5.4','Motion Actuation','A','na','No device-motion functionality in desktop forms or views.',0],
    ['2.5.7','Dragging Movements','AA','manual','Inventory every drag interaction: column reorder, Kanban, file drop zones. Confirm each has a non-drag equivalent.',20],
    ['2.5.8','Target Size (Minimum)','AA','auto','The tool measures target geometry and applies the spacing exception. It cannot judge the "equivalent control" exception, so review flagged items before logging them.',15],
    ['3.1.1','Language of Page','A','auto','The tool checks the html lang attribute.',5],
    ['3.1.2','Language of Parts','AA','cond','Applies if any content is in a second language. Significant for Welsh delivery. Simultaneous bilingual labels will fail.',20],
    ['3.2.1','On Focus','A','manual','Tab through every field. Nothing may change beyond the focus indicator.',15],
    ['3.2.2','On Input','A','manual','Change every field value. Watch for form switching, reloads or dialogs opening without prior warning.',30],
    ['3.2.3','Consistent Navigation','AA','manual','Compare several forms and views. Navigation must appear in the same relative order.',15],
    ['3.2.4','Consistent Identification','AA','manual','Build an inventory of command labels across the app. The same function must have the same label everywhere.',30],
    ['3.2.6','Consistent Help','A','cond','Applies only if a help mechanism exists. If it does, it must sit in the same relative position on every page.',10],
    ['3.3.1','Error Identification','A','manual','Trigger every validation path. Errors must be described in text and identify the field. Confirm they are announced.',30],
    ['3.3.2','Labels or Instructions','A','part','The tool finds inputs with no label. Whether format guidance is adequate is a human judgement.',15],

    ['3.3.4','Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)','AA','manual','Every data-modifying action must be reversible, checked or confirmed. Test bulk actions and destructive commands.',20],
    ['3.3.7','Redundant Entry','A','manual','Walk each end-to-end process. Information entered once must not be requested again.',30],
    ['3.3.8','Accessible Authentication (Minimum)','AA','manual','Assessed at process level with your identity team. Confirm paste works in the password field and a non-transcription MFA route exists.',20],
